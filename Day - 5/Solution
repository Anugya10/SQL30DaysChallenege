/* Write an SQL query to obtain the third transaction of every user. Output the user id, and transaction date.*/

-- My Solution:

with cte as (
    select user_id, transaction_date,
         row_number() over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date) as RW
from transaction)
    select user_id, transaction_date
from CTE
    where RW = 3;

select user_id, 
spend, transaction_date 
from (
    select user_id, spend, transaction_date,
         row_number() over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date) as RW
from transaction) as N
    where RW = 3;
