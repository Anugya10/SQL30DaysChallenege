/*Question asked in Amazon Data Analyst Interview.

Write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.*/

My solution: 

SELECT tweet_count, 
       COUNT(user_id) AS num_users 
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, 
           COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count, 
           EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date) AS year
    FROM tweets
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY user_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date)
) AS posts
GROUP BY tweet_count;
